# Personal Page

This repository contains a simple, futuristic personal website.

## GitHub Pages deployment (user site)

Because you want the site at `https://<your-username>.github.io/`, GitHub Pages expects:

1. The repository name to be `<your-username>.github.io`.
2. The site files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, etc.) in the repository root.

### One-time setup

1. Create or rename the repository to `<your-username>.github.io`.
2. Push this code to the `main` branch.
3. In **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch** and set the branch to `main` with folder `/root`.
4. Wait a minute for GitHub Pages to build.

Your site will be available at: `https://<your-username>.github.io/`.

### Updating content

Edit `index.html` and replace placeholders (role titles, company names, certifications, and education). Then commit and push updates to publish changes.
